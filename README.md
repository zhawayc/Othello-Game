# Othello-Game
### An human-computer interactive Othello Game
The game involves play by two parties on an 8x8 square grid with pieces that have two distinct sides. The goal for each player is to make pieces of their colour constitute a majority of the pieces on the board at the end of the game, by turning over as many of their opponent's pieces as possible.
